Face recognition Comparision on Edge devices:

What is Face recognition from project implementation?
Recognising prescenc of face in an image is Face recognition

Face recognition > Face detection/ Face localisation + Face recognition



Face localisation
> Haar classifier	: Adaboost trained model		: Fast, low Accuracy
> MTCNN 		: CNN network for face localisation	: slow, High Accuracy

MTCNN stands for "Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks." 


Face recognition:
5 different methods

Face Recogniton library : facial landmarks (facial Keypoint detector): 64D Hyperplane  : Clustering --> model1
Face Recogniton library : facial landmarks (facial Keypoint detector): 64D Hyperplane  : SVM ---> model2
Eigen faces : PCA (Principal Component Ananlysis) : model3
VGG16 : Transfer learning technique : Model4 
Facenet : embeddeings + SVM : Model 5


> Training and testing  : time , accuray
> Deployment : Time

LFW -> Labeled faces in the wild
custom dataset : with images

models comparision in windows PC is done

models in comparision in (jetson nano) Ubuntu and Rasberrypi
